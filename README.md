# Flow Studio

This repository contains the source code for Flow Studio, a visual builder for the Flow framework.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo containing two main packages:

-   `/frontend`: The Next.js application that serves the user interface.
-   `/backend`: The Node.js (Express) application that provides the API.

See the README file in each directory for more specific instructions on how to run the individual applications.
